This project showcases a personal finance tracking website, custom-designed in Figma and developed using React with TypeScript. It features seamless integration with the UP banking API through Axios to fetch live financial data securely. 

The website provides a user-friendly interface that dynamically displays financial insights and account balances, helping users manage their finances effectively. The application is designed with performance and security in mind, ensuring that personal data is handled with utmost care. This project demonstrates my capabilities in full-stack development and my commitment to creating practical, user-oriented solutions.
